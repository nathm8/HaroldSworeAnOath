knocking an enemy into a castle they don't own doesn't recolour the castle's knight

                   Balance\Gameplay
------------------------------------------------------
- moar seeds lol
- buying towns with foreign occupants? should be disallowed
------------------------------------------------------
                        Roadmap
------------------------------------------------------
- main menu sequence
    - rules text
- gameover sequence
    - win
    - lose

------------------------------------------------------
                        AI
------------------------------------------------------
- if two adjacent enemies in castle and we're in the castle, stay in it
- buy the most influencial castle (by some guess)
    - closest to existing castle, perhaps

------------------------------------------------------
                       Juice
------------------------------------------------------   
- when mousing over end turn highlight\jiggle unmoved knights
- put UIManager.animateUnitMovement into HexSprite
    - so move tween is from actual position instead of snapping down after pickup
- highlight which knight belongs to a castle with CostIndicator
    - outline sprite?
- some font colours a bit hard to read on CostIndicator
    - bg sprite?
- GUI
    - tween up\down the numbers
    - have crowns shoot at purchased town from GUI
    - delay after turn ends so we can see DR go up
    - have hexes shoot at DR symbol

------------------------------------------------------   
                      Project
------------------------------------------------------   
- package and put on Itch
    - submit to gamejam
- upload to git
    - pick an OS license
- comment, lol
- refactor
