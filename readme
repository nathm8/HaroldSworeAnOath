TODO
==================================================

Juice
--------------------------------------------------
Add additional mapgen animations
    randomly pick tween in:
        spiral (done)
        by q or r coords
        completely random

Architecture
--------------------------------------------------
fix up "init" in Sprite classes, either superclass to take repetition in constructor
out or have singleton resource manager do the setCenterRatio calls.

have dedicated messaging queue \ listeners on objects instead of just having scenes 
do it. Have listener class, component of others, to generalise. Message queue is 
singleton, polled in update.

Have GameObject class, just for propagating update().
    think carefully about any other functionality, heaps covers node stuff pretty 
    well already
        can we just make an Abstract on Heaps' Abstract class instead?

Have singleton Rand so we have control seeds

Make actual 2d beziers

Gameplay Ideas
--------------------------------------------------
Have multiple islands. Have 1-1 connections between "close islands" via ports. Travel time 
is one turn, transported units are then recruitable. Ports can recruit as Capitols but only
from the pool of "transported" units. Transported units costs upkeep as usual. A waiting unit
at a Port can be sent back to the other port.
    AI considerations on not having too many in port important. Don't want too much eco drain

Engineer unit to create\destroy forts. Cannon unit for ranged attacks
    Units in fort do one better than normal. Win instead of draw, draw instead of lose.
    Cannons disable forts for a turn, stun unit inside. Stunned units do not get fort bonus.
